## Overview

This project was created as part of the Software Development Bootcamp â€“ Technical Challenge. The goal was to build a simple but interactive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches and displays data from an external API.

For my project, I chose the Game of Thrones API (An API of Ice and Fire) to display information about characters, houses, and books from the Game of Thrones universe.

- The project demonstrates:

- Fetching data from an external API

- Dynamically updating a web page with JavaScript

- Styling and structuring the page using HTML and CSS

- Adding interactivity such as a search function and clickable buttons

## Technologies Used

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for responsive design and styling

JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity and API integration
